Summ: 
Great article by Cambi on two stelae found in Salona form Legio VII. Breaks down their provenance, style, content, dating and significance well, linking them to many comparanda from Legio VII and other legions/cohorts. Great and brief discussion of the origin of the ‘door schema', which he suggests was more linked to the stone masons than the legion - as it did not move with Legio VII to the Danube, but remained to be used by the replacing cohorts. Also, concludes that it supports the argument that Legio VII soldiers consciously chose these styles to create/nourish sense of legionary community. Also, significantly, he also proposes that there was a specific portion of the cemetery in Salona's north-eastern cemetery that was for legio VII's vexillation at Salona (a vexelation he also proposes the existence of in this paper).},

This paper publishes 7 stelae found in late antqiue tomb at Dugpolje (the tomb is made of the stelae)
- Cambi first goes over the state, discovery of the tomb (pp 147-14), then outlines its form and compares it to that of similar 'repurpased-stelae tombs' from Salona (pp. 148-154).
The Cambis disucsses the stelae, giving the inscription and a description of their context, content and (basic) signifiance (pp. 154-165).
1. Legio VII member, Gaius Julius (doors) - put up by a Gaius Mummius.
2. Stela of Severus, eques of Alae IV NCR (Cambi: Noricorum (or Numidiorum) Civium Romanorum?) (Stela has doors). Put up by a 'frater'
3. stela of Gaius Julius, miles of cohortis II Cyrrhestarum (put up by a 'frater'/'comrade' Gaius Julius Capula) - stela has arrows, bow and quiver.
4. Stela of Gaius Julius Andromachus, miles of cohortis II Cyrrhestarum, put up by Gaius Julius Apollo, a 'soldalis'(comade? likely fellow soldier?), stela has arrows, bow and quiver.
5. Stela of unknown soldier, inscription stolen, however - there is a tuba and a shield, which likely indicates membership within a military unit as a musician.
6. Stela of unknown soldier, inscription damaged, however, there is a weapons frieze and a door motif, which suggests that the miles was from Legio VII, but may also have been from other legio/unit.
7. Stela of Papiria Metellica, there are no military members mentioned, so it is unique to the corpus from this Late Antique Grave from Dugpolje.
Cambi then looks at the material, shape style of the stela in more depth: (pp.166-171)
Nos. 1, 2 and 6 seem to be in the typical military style of those from Tilurium. They have the three main features of the classic Legio VII stela - doors, inscriptions field inside two colums, and a naiksos.
Nos. 3 and 4 are also similar besides the door, so may also have been rpoduced at Tilurium.
pp. 167-168, Cambi looks over the issue of origins of the door monuments (again) - this time looking towards italy. Suggests that the Tilurian stelae produced in the workshop at Tilurium slowly lost the door motif as Legio VII left, and other units came to the site/region. Seen with nos 3-4, from Cohors II Cyrrhestarum, as well as others at Burnum, and Salona. 
169 - Cambi claims that the doors underwent a reduction over time, resulting in the style of just two pannels that we see with the nos 3-4, from Cohors II Cyrrhestarum. Importantly, when the reduced style appears on the stleae of Legio VII soldiers, they bear the CPF titles and post-date 42 CE, so we can date this change to pre42CE, from when the Legio First arrive din the province.
Thus - Cambi connects monuments 1,2,3,4,6 as the same workshop/reduction of same style.
No. 5 stands out, however, he is framed like the rest of the stelae, perhaps then also from Tilurium, or following the style of its workshop.
p. 170. Cambi Summarises his take on the development of the stela. He purports that it was not drawn from Asia, but from Italy, and not imposed on the stonemasons of tilurium by the arriving Legio VII soldiers from the East.
He notes that the stoneMasons did not travel with the legio to the Danubian Limes.
p. 171 Cambi purports that the stelae could have been produced by two(three) generations of stonemasons. He suggests that the stelae from Ljubuski were also produced in Tilurium then carted down. The better quality stela found in Salona is evidence of a miles requesting a stela with a particular military iconography, but by a better stonemason (who was evidencelty open to requests).
p. 172-4 Cambi dates the stelae and notes possibilities for further research: e.g. stelae of Cohors II Cyrrhestarum members have been fond in Tilurium and Salona, so they were obviously near the site, as such, more research is required to find the exact site.

Abstract: Two new tombstones (stelae) bearing the names of soldiers of the 7th legion have been discovered in the Cetina River valley at Garduii near Trilj, where the military camp of the legio VII was located as early as the beginning of the 1st century AD.
This article contains stylistic-decorative and epigraphic analyses of both monuments. The first, the tombstone of-Lucius Attius, son of Lucius, originally from Augusta and enrolled in the 'tribus Sergia, is fragmentary and of somewhat more modest dimensions. The other stele is particularly valuable and interesting. This was the tombtone of Lucius Mummius, son of Lucius, originally, from Ancyra in Asia Minor, enrolled in the tribus of Fabia.
 The author emphasises that both monuments confirm previous claims that the soldiers of the 7th legion had been recruited in Asia.Minor, the cradle of the Phrygian deity Attis. The figure in the gable of the second more massive stele, erected by Marcus Cornelius Chrestus, a freedman of Marcus Cornelius, is interpreted as an image of Attis. This is the .second known figure of Attis to have been found in the gable-of a stele in the Cetina region. Various peculiarities of. This stele are pointed out, {\textperiodcentered}such{\textperiodcentered} as the panel bearing reliefs of{\_} military decorations (phalerae), as well as an exceptionally valuable epigram composed in elegiac distich. This is a type of lyric poem composed in distichs or couplets – three stanzas of two lines with alternate Hexameters and pentameters.
The stelae of Lucius Atius, who died at age 30 after eight years of military service, as well as that of Lucius Mummius, who died at age 36 after 16 years in the army, are dated by the author to the first decades of the 1st century AD. Both stelae, certainly were erected prior to the unsuccessful rebellion of Lucius Aruncius Scribonianus, i.e. prior to 42 AD, when the 7th legion received the honorific title Claudia Pia Fidelis.

They arc dated, catalogued, described and analysed after decorative and tectonic elements. Special attention has been done to die portrait stele of Sempronia Quarla as the main standpoint for dating most of other monuments. On the basis of stylistic and fashion characteristics of die late woman portrait the inscription is put at the end of Antonin or at the beginning of Early Sever period (180-210) AD. Another monument deserving even greater attention is that of Gaius Ixsllius Valcns, Legion VII soldier's grave inscription, being the oldest inscription in this work (mid !“ cent AD). The person in question was of Italic origin. At the end of this paper a short report has been given on the state of discovering of the south-east necropolis so far, and the problem of ubication of the central communication where the necropolis happened to be found. The site where die findings of the monuments From this paper were found, reinforces Dyggve's hypothesis that die necropolis had been situated on both sides of the road Salona - Epclium; at the very place where tire road passed over Gospin otok, "the bridge VII” on its way to Epetium.

The authors compare the four stelae and their poems with one another, and with other known poetic stelae (mostly from Italy and Dalmatia), making a number of interesting findings. Firstly, there are similarities in phrase and pattern which suggests some kind of ‘poets manual' in the Empire, with pre-made, or partially made poems/poem structures. Two Legio VII poems (Q. Baebius and G. Iulius) are very similar in style, with similar phrases and seem to be from same person – same poet at Tilurium? Stelae of Ancharenus is v different but may be still written by same poet. The final stelae (L. Mummius), with the unique poem, was almost definitely not same poet, with more complex style (and visuals too). All four are from Asia (the soldiers). The stelae 1, 2, 3 have very similar iconography too. In fact, they fit into the broader style of Legio VII, just with the addition of a poem. 4th stela of Mummius, probably from another wokshop – inscriptions are better carved (*perhaps from a more skilled craftsman in Salona?*). No cognomen (or cpf), meaning pre-Claudius.},

After outlining the nature of the monument, the history of its design, and typologically anaylsing its porta inferi motif, Domagoj provides a good argument for the third line of the inscription to be reconstructed as "MIL(es) L[EG(ionis) VII C(laudiae) P(iae)] F(idelis), MIL(es)", acknowledging that Legio IV and XI are also technically possible.
Domagoj also provides great commentory on the 1) door motif/porta inferi, and 2) the tools depicted upon the monument in the porta inferi - including that they were not 'military', but related to construction(stonemason) activities.
Main usefulness of paper is (as usual for Croatian papers) great referencing.},
