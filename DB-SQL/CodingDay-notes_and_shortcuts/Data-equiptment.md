2. Catapult bolt-head, P. 1.2
Inv. no. MCK B-923
Material: iron Dimensions: length 10.7 cm, diameter of socket 1 cm, weight: 40 g

3. Catapult bolt-head, P. 1.3 Inv. no. AMS H 6174
Material: iron
Dimensions: length: 7.6 cm, length of head: 5.2 cm, length of tang: 2.4 cm, width of head at widest point: 1.3 cm, width of tang at widest section: 0.4 cm, weight: 40 g
Description: Javelin head and tang have a rectangular cross-section; the tang is wider near the head, which has an oblong pyramidal shape. The tip is flattened. It belongs to a relatively rare variant with a tang, with a head twice the length of the tang, a feature that dates it to the imperial period. As in the Roman army, only the legions, praetorians and navy used catapults, this piece can be dated to the first two thirds of the first century, i.e., the period when the legion was posted in Gardun.

5. Spearhead, P. 2.1
Inv. no. AMS H 5995
Material: iron
Dimensions: length 29.2 cm, length of socket 11.5 cm, length of head 17.7 cm, diameter of socket at wid- est part 2.2 cm, width of head at widest part 3.6 cm, weight: 155 g Description: Socketed leaf-shaped spearhead, with damaged edges and a very prominent longitudinal mid-rib. In the Roman army, spears were wielded by the infantry and cavalry, and its various shapes and sizes were dictated by its function, since it was used for throwing as well as for close combat. Although this type of weapon cannot be dated on typological grounds, this piece has been precisely dated thanks to the circumstances of the find. It was found in Gardun in 1921, together with an arrowhead (AMS inv. no. H 6010) and a Justinian coin dated to the thirtieth year of his reign (556/557). This allows dating to the early Byzantine Justinian period.

8. Arrowhead, P. 2.4
Inv. no. AMS H 6012
Material: iron
Dimensions: length 8.6 cm, length of head 3.9 cm, length of socket 4.7 cm, width of socket 0.9 cm, width of head 1.6 cm, weight 20 g
Description: The tip of the arrow with a rhombic head and a socket are preserved. It belongs to the group of arrows with a flattened head, a shape that was not used for ballistic devices. Its size and weight are another in- dication that this object was probably an arrow for a bow. The head has a rhombic shape and flat cross-sec- tion. Even though this type of weapon cannot be dated by typological features, this piece has been dated with precision due to the circumstances of the find. To be precise, it was found in Gardun together with a spear tip (cat. no. 5, P. 2.1) and a Justinian coin dated to the thirtieth year of his reign (556/557). This allows dating to the early Byzantine Justinian period.

Description: Military dagger with scabbard. It consists of a hilt with a cross-guard and a blade in a sheath. The lower part of the scabbard is missing. The grip begins with a pommel that has three rivets on top, set next to each other and decorated with red enamel. On the semi-circular plate of the pommel there are another two rivets separated by a trident motif rendered in copper wire inlay. An elliptical widening with a rivet in the middle runs along the centre of the grip. The grip is decorated with inlaid linear motifs in silver and copper wire. Two rivets on the back of the grip con- nected the outer mount with the tang and wooden plates. The grip tapers gently from the pommel to the cross-guard, and it has a convex cross-section down its entire length. The lateral sides of the dagger are re- inforced with mounts at places where the scabbard is widest. The mounts are supported with rivets identi- cal to those on the grip of the dagger, and decorated with red enamel. Each of the lower two mounts has one preserved link in the eye. The entire front of the scabbard is richly decorated with inlaid silver and cop- per threads and divided into four fields. The back of the scabbard is undecorated.
