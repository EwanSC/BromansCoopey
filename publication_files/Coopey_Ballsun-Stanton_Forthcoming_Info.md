-   **Abstract**: \
    This database was designed to facilitate and supplement
    archaeological and epigraphical research conducted as part of a
    Master of Research thesis submitted in December 2020. The project
    builds upon and digitises the robust catalogic work of scholars
    local to the modern region, such as Domagoj Tončinić's 'Monuments of
    Legio VII in the Roman Province of Dalmatia'. This database stores
    various types of geographical, epigraphical, visual, and historical
    data related to Roman funerary and sacral inscriptions belonging to,
    or commemorating, servicemen or veterans of the Roman Seventh Legion
    (*Legio VII*) in the province of *Dalmatia *(the modern Eastern
    Adriatic coastline and hinterland). This project, and the related
    thesis '*Fratres Romani* in *Dalmatia*’,* *investigated the social
    dynamics of *Legio VII*, as well as processes of identity and
    community construction within the unit. It is hoped that this
    dataset will facilitate future research into military life in
    *Dalmatia*, as well as investigations of other corpora of Roman
    funerary stelae, as the general form of the dataset is
    transplantable onto epigraphical material from different regions of
    the Roman world.

**Other information from the Author Publishing Guidelines**

-   **Period**: Early Roman Empire (30 BCE – 259 CE)

-   **Keywords**: Roman Empire, epigraphy, archaeology, Roman military,
    Dalmatia, monuments

-   **Potential Applications of the Data**: The dataset has been
    collated to facilitate further research into the seventh legion in
    *Dalmatia* and their monuments. The structure of this dataset has
    also been designed to best capture the types of epigraphical data
    which are key for investigating the social dynamics of a Roman
    community through their inscribed monuments, and it is hoped that
    future researchers can adapt this database structure onto other
    Roman epigraphic datasets.

-   **Support**: This research was supported by the Croatian Studies
    Foundation (CSF) 2020 Community, Culture and Research Scheme, and
    the Macquarie University Macquarie Research Excellence Scholarship
    Scheme (MQRES).
