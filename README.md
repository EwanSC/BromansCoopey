## PhD Thesis Database Repository
This branch is a working repository containing a database created for my PhD in History and Archaeology (2021-2024). The database is based off of one developed during my Master of Research (2020) and published through [Open Context](https://opencontext.org/projects/7a06aecd-8b0e-4f94-b0f9-5c9fb649e003). The DB comprises tables made for collecting and storing data related to Roman inscriptions and small archaeological find found relating to Roman military in the province of Dalmatia (modern Eastern Adriatic coastline and hinterland).
