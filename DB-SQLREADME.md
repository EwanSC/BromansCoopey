MRes Thesis Reposistory.
This repository contains files related to a database created for a Master of Research, Ancient History, thesis in 2020. The DB comprises tables made for collecting and storing data related to Roman inscriptions found relating to the Seventh Legio (Legio VII) in Dalmatia (modern Eastern Adriatic coastline and hinterland).
This is currently a wotk in progress, a Beta if you will (like all good DBs!!).
